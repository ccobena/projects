= Multi tenancy support

Multi tenancy allows same instance of {this-platform} {this-application} to connect to different operators, each having its own  links and point-codes. 

Multi tenancy is achieved by having a model of SS7 network as a splitted to several logical networks.
Each logical network has a corresponded key "networkId". It is digital one and default value (if we do not specify it) - 0.
 

NetworkId value is assigned for a configurable objects: 

* SCCP SAP
* SCCP Rule        

NetworkId is also assigned to activities: 

* SccpMessage (assigned by Service Acess Point - SAP for SS7 originated messages, assigned by TCAP Dialog for TCAP originated messages)
* TCAP Dialog (assigned by SccpMessage for SCCP originated messages, assigned by upper Dialog for user messages)
* MAP / CAP Dialog (same as TCAP Dialog)
* SCCP rule is taken into account only when SCCP rule networkId == SccpMessage networkId
