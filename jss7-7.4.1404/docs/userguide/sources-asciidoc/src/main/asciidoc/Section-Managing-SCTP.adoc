= SCTP Management

[[_managing_sctp_using_cli]]
== Using CLI

You can manage all SCTP related configurations through the Command Line Interface by using the `sctp` command.
You can create, destroy, start and stop SCTP Servers / Associations by issuing the `sctp` command with appropriate parameters. 

[[_managing_sctp_using_gui]]
== Using GUI

The GUI will allow you to manage your SCTP Servers and Associations efficiently using a user-friendly interface.
Open a Web Browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/jss7-management-console/. Click on the 'SCTP' link in the left panel.
The main panel will display the names of all configured SCTP Management units.
To configure or view the settings of a particular SCTP Management Unit you must click on the name of that unit.
The GUI will look similar to the figure below and is divided into three tabs. 

.GUI - SCTP Management
image::images/GUI_SCTP_Management.png[]

The first tab will display the properties of the SCTP Management unit.
These details displayed here are fetched from the XML descriptor file [path]_jboss-beans.xml_, which is  located at [path]_$JBOSS_HOME/server/profile_name/deploy/mobicents-ss7-service/META-INF_, where  [app]`profile_name` is the server profile name.
These properties can be modified here in the GUI.
To modify them you must click the pencil, change the value and save.
The GUI will then display the modified values.
 

The other two tabs will allow you to manage and monitor all Servers and Associations within this SCTP Management unit.
 

[[_sctp_properties]]
== SCTP stack properties

[[_sctp_property_connectdelay]]
=== Connect Delay

[[_sctp_property_connectdelay_cli]]
==== Using CLI

You can set the 'Connect Delay (milliseconds)' by issuing the command `sctp set connectdelay` with appropriate parameters as described below.
You can verify this by issuing the command `sctp get connectdelay` which will display the value set for this property. 

----

Name
	sctp set connectdelay 

SYNOPSIS
	sctp set connectdelay <connectdelay> stackname <stack-name>

DESCRIPTION
	If the SCTP Socket is client-side, connectDelay specifies 
	the delay time in milliseconds after which a connection 
	with the server will be attempted. This delay is necessary 
	when there is network disruption and the connection between 
	the client and the server breaks, so that the SCTP stack 
	doesn't continuously attempt to reconnect. 
	Defalut is 30000 milliseconds.
	
PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<connectdelay>	-	Connect delay in milliseconds.
	
	Optional Parameters

	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed. 
					If not passed, the first stack configured in ShellExecutor
					will be used.	

EXAMPLES
	sctp set connectdelay 40000

[[_sctp_property_singlethread]]
=== Single Thread

You can modify the settings for the parameter 'singlethread' only when the SCTP Stack is not running.
In addition, this parameter cannot be modified through the CLI or GUI.
You will have to invoke the setter function directly from the source code.
 

If you are using the JBoss Application Server, then you can set this parameter by adding a property (as shown below) to the XML descriptor file [path]_jboss-beans.xml_, which is located at [path]_$JBOSS_HOME/server/profile_name/deploy/mobicents-ss7-service/META-INF_, where [app]`profile_name` is the server profile name. 
----

/*Add property for the parameter 'singleThread' to jboss-beans.xml file and specify settings to true or false*/

	the paramter 'singlethread' must be set to false before you can change the
	number of worker threads to more than one.
	
	The settings can be modified only when the SCTP Stack is not running.
	To modify this parameter you must invoke the setter function
	directly from the code or if you are using the JBoss AS, you can add a 
	property to the XML descriptor file jboss-beans.xml. You cannot change the
	settings through the CLI.

	<socket-type>	-	If you do not specify the socket-type as "TCP",
					by default it will be SCTP.
					
	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed. 
						If not passed, the first stack configured in ShellExecutor
						will be used.

	<peer-port> <host- ip> <host-port> <socket-type> stackname <stack-name>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to create a new SCTP (Client side or Server side) 
	association. 

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<assoc-name>		-	Name of the new Association created. This must be 
					unique and takes any String value.

	<CLIENT | SERVER>	-	Specify if this association is client side or 
					server side. If it is client side, it will 
					initiate the connection to peer. If it is server 
					side, it will wait for peer to initiate the
					connection. The connection request will be 
					accepted from peer-ip: peer:port.

	<peer-ip>		-	In a client side association, the server IP 
					address to which the client is connecting to.

					In a server side association, the client IP 
					address from which connections will be accepted.
	
	<peer-port>		-	In a client side association, the server Port 
					to which the client is connecting to.

					In a server side association, the client port from 
					which connections will be accepted.

	<host-ip>		-	In a client side association, the local IP address
					to which the socket will bind to. 
			
					For SCTP multi-home support, you can pass multiple
					IP addresses as comma separated values. The 
					Association will bind to the primary IP address 
					and when it becomes unavailable, it will 
					automatically fall back to secondary address. 
					If the socket-type is TCP, these comma separated 
					values will be ignored and the Assocation will 
					always bind to the primary IP address (the first
					value in the comma separated list). This is 
					required only for a client side Association. 
					
					For a server side association, even if you specify
					these values it will be ignored.
	
	<host-port>		-	In a client side association, the local port to
					which the socket will bind to. This is 
					required only for a client side Association.
					
					For a server side association, even if you specify
					these values it will be ignored.

	<server-name>	-	In a server-side association, the server-name must
					be passed to associate with the Server identified 
					by that name. You must ensure that the Server 
					identified by server-name has already been created 
					using the sctp server create command. 

					In a client-side association, this is not required 
					and you should not pass this parameter.

	Optional Parameters
	
	<socket-type>	-	If you do not specify the socket-type as "TCP", 
					by default it will be SCTP. If it is a
					SERVER SCTP Association, the socket-type must 
					match with the one specified while creating the
					Server.
						
	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed. 
					If not passed, the first stack configured in ShellExecutor
					will be used. 					

EXAMPLES
	sctp association create Assoc1 CLIENT 
	192.168.56.101 2905 192.168.56.1,192.168.56.1 2905
	
	The above command will create a new CLIENT SCTP Association identified as Assoc1. 
	The client side will initiate the connection. It will bind the 
	host-ip 192.168.56.1 and host-port 2905 to the Server IP 192.168.56.101 and 
	port 2905.

	sctp association create Assoc2 SERVER TestServer 192.168.56.1 2905
