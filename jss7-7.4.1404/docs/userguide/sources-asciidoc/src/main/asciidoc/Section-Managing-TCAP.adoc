[[_managing_tcap]]
= TCAP Management

Transaction Capabilities Application Part  , from ITU-T recommendations Q.771-Q.775 or ANSI T1.114 is a protocol for Signalling System 7 networks.
Its primary purpose is to facilitate multiple concurrent dialogs between the same sub-systems on the same machines, using Transaction IDs to differentiate these, similar  to the way TCP ports facilitate multiplexing connections between the same IP addresses on the Internet. 

[[_managing_tcap_using_cli]]
== Using CLI

You can manage all TCAP stack properties through the Command Line Interface by using the `tcap` command. 

[[_managing_tcap_using_gui]]
== Using GUI

The GUI will allow you to manage your TCAP configurations efficiently using a user-friendly interface.
Open a Web Browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/jss7-management-console/. Click on the 'TCAP' link in the left panel.
The main panel will display the names of all configured TCAP Management units.
To configure or view the settings of a particular TCAP Management Unit  you must click on the name of that unit.
The GUI will look similar to the figure below.
 

.GUI - TCAP Management
image::images/GUI_TCAP_Management.png[]

The first tab will display the properties of the TCAP Management unit.
These details displayed here are fetched from the XML descriptor file [path]_jboss-beans.xml_, which is  located at [path]_$JBOSS_HOME/server/profile_name/deploy/mobicents-ss7-service/META-INF_, where  [app]`profile_name` is the server profile name.
These properties can be modified here in the GUI.
To modify them you must click the pencil, change value and save.
The GUI will then display the modified values.

[[_tcap_property_dialogidletimeout]]
=== Dialog Idle Timeout

[[_tcap_property_dialogidletimeout_cli]]
==== Using CLI

You can set the 'dialogidletimeout' by issuing the command `tcap set dialogidletimeout` with appropriate parameters as described below.

Name
	tcap set dialogidletimeout 

SYNOPSIS
	tcap set dialogidletimeout <dialogidletimeout> stackname <stack-name>

DESCRIPTION
	Sets millisecond value for dialog timeout. It specifies how long 
	dialog can be idle - not receive/send any messages.
	When a timeout occurs the method `TCListener.onDialogTimeout()` will be
	invoked. If a TCAP-User does not invoke `Dialog.keepAlive()` inside
	the method `TCListener.onDialogTimeout()`, the TCAP Dialog will be
	released.
	
PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters

	<dialogidletimeout>	-	Timeout in milliseconds.
	
	Optional Parameters

	<stack-name>	-	Name of the stack on which this command is executed. 
					If not passed, the first stack configured in ShellExecutor
					will be used.	

EXAMPLES
	tcap set dialogidletimeout 30000

Name
	tcap set invoketimeout 

SYNOPSIS
	tcap set invoketimeout <invoketimeout> stackname <stack-name>

DESCRIPTION
	Sets the Invoke timeout for this invoke. This property specifies,

	before a timeout occurs.
	If a TCAP-User does not specify a custom Invoke timeout when
	sending a new Invoke, this default value will be used for outgoing
	Invoke timeout. When this timeout occurs `TCListener.onInvokeTimeout()`
	will be invoked.
	invoketimeout should always be less than dialogidletimeout.
	This parameter affects if we use TCAP stack as the upperst level or
	we have implemented our own stack that reuses TCAP stack. 
	Restcomm MAP and CAP stacks overrides this parameter at their levels
	and this parameter deos not affect these stacks.

[[_tcap_property_previewmode]]
=== Preview Mode

You can modify the settings for the parameter 'previewmode' only when the TCAP Stack is not running.
In addition, this parameter cannot be modified through the CLI or GUI.
You will have to invoke the setter function directly from the source code.
 

If you are using the JBoss Application Server, then you can set this parameter by adding a property (as shown below) to the XML descriptor file [path]_jboss-beans.xml_, which is located at [path]_$JBOSS_HOME/server/profile_name/deploy/mobicents-ss7-service/META-INF_, where [app]`profile_name` is the server profile name. 
----

/*Add property for the parameter 'previewmode' to jboss-beans.xml file and specify true or false*/ 
<property name="previewMode">true</property>
----		 

The current settings of the parameter can be viewed in the GUI or by invoking the appropriate CLI command as described below. 

[[_tcap_property_previewmode_cli]]
==== Using CLI

You can retrieve the current settings of the parameter 'previewmode' by issuing the command `sctp get previewmode`.
However as explained above, you cannot modify the settings through the CLI. 

----

Name
	tcap get previewmode 

SYNOPSIS
	tcap get previewmode 

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to retrieve the current settings of the parameter
	'previewMode'. The 'previewMode' parameter is used for special processing 
	mode.
	
	When Preview Mode is set to true:
	- In TCAP level the stack only listens for incoming messages and
	sends nothing.
	- Methods like send(), close(), sendComponent() and other such methods
	do nothing.
	- A TCAP Dialog is temporary. The TCAP Dialog is discarded after 
	any incoming message like TC-BEGIN or TC-CONTINUE has been processed.
	- For any incoming messages (including TC-CONTINUE, TC-END, TC-ABORT) a new 
	TCAP Dialog is created (and then deleted).
	- There are no timers and timeouts.
	
	The settings of this parameter can be modified only when the TCAP Stack is
	not running. To modify this parameter you must invoke the setter function
	directly from the code or if you are using the JBoss AS, you can add a 
	property to the XML descriptor file jboss-beans.xml. You cannot change the
	settings through the CLI.
----

[[_tcap_property_previewmode_gui]]
