[[_managing_sccp]]
= SCCP Management

SCCP provides connectionless and connection-oriented network services.
This includes address(GTT) translation and routing, flow control, segmentation and reassembly.
A global title is an address (e.g., a dialed 800 number, calling card number, or mobile subscriber identification number) which is translated by SCCP into a destination  point code and subsystem number.
A subsystem number uniquely identifies an application at the destination signaling point.  is used as the  transport layer for -based services. 

The first step in configuring SCCP is defining service access points (sap). This step is mandatory.
Each SCCP stack can use one or more Mtp3UserPart  (Refer <<_configuring_sccp>> about Mtp3UserPart settings). A sap is a logical definition of the Mtp3UserPart [corresponding local SPC,  network indicator (NI) and a set of destinations (remote SPC list)].  

The second step is the definition of a list of available remote signaling pointcodes (SPC - rsp) and  a list of available remote Sub-Systems (SNN - rss). This step is also mandatory.
If routing only by GlobalTitle is used then it is not required to configure remote Sub-Systems. 

Since  acts as a message router, it is required to configure routing information.
Rules (rule), primary and backup (address) (if backup addresses are available)  addresses should be configured.
If XUDT and LUDT messages are available in the SS7 network, you should configure a set of long message rules (lmr) that will allow long messages.
This step is not mandatory.
If no long message rules are configured only UDT messages will be used. 

The last step is optional.
You can configure a set of concerned signaling point codes (csp). Each point code will be announced when local SCCP user becomes unavailable. 

[[_managing_sccp_using_cli]]
== Using CLI

You can manage all SCCP related configurations through the Command Line Interface by using the `sccp` command with appropriate parameters.
You can create, modify, delete  and view SCCP Service Access Points (sap) and Destinations (dest), Remote Signaling Point Codes (rsp), Remote Sub Systems (rss), Concerned Signaling Point Codes (csp),  Routing information (rules, primary and backup addresses) and Long Message Rules (lmr). You can also set and get values for general parameters using this command. 

[[_managing_sccp_using_gui]]
== Using GUI

The GUI will allow you to manage your SCCP configurations efficiently using a user-friendly interface.
Open a Web Browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080/jss7-management-console/.  Click on the 'SCCP' link in the left panel.
The main panel will display the names of all configured SCCP Management units.
To configure or view the settings of a particular SCCP Management  Unit you must click on the name of that unit.
The GUI will look similar to the figure below and is divided into tabs.
 

The first tab will display the properties of the SCCP Management unit.
These details displayed here are fetched from the XML descriptor file [path]_jboss-beans.xml_, which is  located at [path]_$JBOSS_HOME/server/profile_name/deploy/mobicents-ss7-service/META-INF_, where [app]`profile_name` is the server profile name.
These properties can be modified here in the GUI.
To modify them you must click on pencil, make changes and save.
The GUI will then display the modified values.

== Create a new Primary/Backup address

[[_managing_sccp_addr_create_cli]]
=== Using CLI

You can create a new primary address or backup address of translation by issuing the command `sccp address create` with appropriate parameters as described below: 

----

Name
	sccp address create

SYNOPSIS
	sccp address create <id> <address-indicator> <point-code> <subsystem-number> 
	<translation-type> <numbering-plan> <nature-of-address-indicator> <digits>
	stackname <stack-name>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to create a new primary address or backup address of 
	translation. You can create a new newCallingParty address as well
	using this command. The global title address information of this command is combined with
	the global title being translated by examining the mask provided in the 
	'sccp rule create' command. 

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters
                                              
	<id>			-	A unique number to identify this address.

	<address-indicator>	-	The address indicator is the first field in a SCCP 
					Party Address (called/calling) and is one octet in
					length. Its function is to indicate which
					information elements are present so that the 
					address can be interpreted. In other words, it 
					indicates the type of addressing information that 
					is to be found in the address field. The 
					addressing information from the original global 
					title is then compared with the passed address
					information to match the rule.

					Only two fields of Address Indicator is used now for GTT:
                    - GT Indicator (this is used for GlobalTitle type that
                      will be created)
                    - Routing Indicator bit (0 = Route on GT, 1 = Route on
                      PC + SSN)
                    GT Indicator for ITU-T network that is mostly used is -
                    0100 (GT includes Translation Type, Numbering Plan and
                    Encoding Scheme and Nature of Address). Digital value
                    for it is - 16.
                    For 0100 GT Indicator we will use two possible values:
                    16 - 0100 GT Indicator and Route on GT
                    80 - 0100 GT Indicator and Route on PC + SSN
                    Even when SCCP stack works in ANSI mode Address Indicator
                    value for CLI and GUI must have values that we use for
                    ITU-T mode.

	<point-code>		-	MTP Signaling Point Code.
					This parameter contains a point code to which message will
					be routed after GTT (DPC field).
					This parameter is mandatory.

                    We need this parameter if at least one section of Rule
                    mask contains "R" (replace) value. Else set this field
                    to "0". If this field is needed it should contain the

[[_managing_sccp_rule_create]]
== Create a new SCCP Rule

=== Sorting Algorithm

When you define Rules, a comparison function imposes ordering the collection of SCCP Rules using a sorting algorithm that is based on the GT digits.
The algorithm is defined below: 

. Rules defined with OriginationType==localOriginated or OriginationType==remoteOriginated, are always at the top of the list.
  Rules defined with OriginationType==All are always at the bottom of the list.
+
Among rules with the same values for OriginationType (All or localOriginated/remoteOriginated), the sorting is done using the below rules. 

. Rules with GT digits having no wildcard (* or ?) are always at the top of the list.
  Between two Rules with GT digits, both having no wildcards, the one with the shortest length is at the top of the list.
  For example, Digit1 "123456" will be above Digit2 "1234567890" and this will be above Digit3 "999/*
. Rules with GT digits having the wildcard "?" are always above digits having the wildcard "\*". For example, Digit1 "800/????/9" will be above Digit2 "999/*
. Between Rules with two GT digits both having wildcard "?", the one with the least number of wildcard "?" is at the top of the list.
  For example, Digit1 "800/????/9" will be above Digit2 "800/?????/9"
. Between Rules with two GT digits both having an equal number of wildcard "?", the digit whose first appearance of "?" is after other, is at the top of the list.
  For example between Digit1 "80/??/0/???/9" and Digit 2 "800/?????/9", Digit2 is above Digit1.

When a Rule is compared during Translation, comparison always starts from the top of the list.

=== Using CLI

You can modify the values of a Rule by issuing the command `sccp rule modify` with appropriate parameters as described below: 

----

Name
	sccp rule modify

SYNOPSIS
	sccp rule modify <id> <mask> <address-indicator> <point-code> <subsystem-number> 
	<translation-type> <numbering-plan> <nature-of-address-indicator> <digits> 
	<ruleType> <primary-address-id> backup-addressid <backup-address-id> 
	loadsharing-algo <loadsharing-algorithm> newcgparty-addressid 
	<new-callingPartyAddress-id> origination-type <originationType>
	stackname <stack-name> networkid <networkId>

DESCRIPTION
	This command is used to modify the values of a SCCP Route previously defined.

PARAMETERS

	Standard Parameters
                                              
	<id>			-	A unique number to identify this Rule.

	<mask>			-	A mask defines which part of the originally dialed 
					digits remains in the translated digits and which
					part is replaced by the digits from primary or 
					backup address. A mask is divided into sections by 
					separator '/'. The number of sections in a mask
					should be equal to the sections in digits passed 
					in this command and the sections in primary or 
					backup address. This paramter is mandatory.

					MASK DEFINITIONS

					Mnemonic	Function
					----------------------------------	
					- 		Ignore

					/		Separator used to split the mask 
							into sections.

					K		Retain the original dialed digits 
							of this section in the translated 
							digits.

					R		Replace the original dialed digits 
							of this section with the same 
							section from primary or backup 
							address in the translated digits.

	<address-indicator>	-	The address indicator is the first field in a SCCP 
					Party Address (called/calling) and is one octet in
					length. Its function is to indicate which
					information elements are present so that the 
					address can be interpreted. In other words, it 
					indicates the type of addressing information that 
					is to be found in the address field. The 
					addressing information from the original global 
					title is then compared with the passed address
					information to match the rule.
