Name
	sctp set workerthreads 

SYNOPSIS
	sctp set workerthreads <workerthreads> stackname <stack-name>

DESCRIPTION
	By default, SCTP stack is implemented such that one thread is 
	dedicated for I/O and one thread for calling applications above SCTP. 
	It is possible to configure multiple threads for calling applications 
	above SCTP. In that case you must set the property singleThread to 
	false and assign the number of threads you require to the property 
	workerThreads
	
PARAMETERS
